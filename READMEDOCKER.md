## Docker Migration for YourCinemaFilms

I've set up all the necessary Docker configuration files for your YourCinemaFilms application. This approach allows you to containerize your application on Windows first, test it, and then easily migrate it to your Ubuntu server.

## Next Steps

Here's what you should do next:

1. **Install Docker Desktop for Windows**:
   - Download and install from [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
   - This will give you both Docker and Docker Compose on your Windows machine

2. **Run the setup script**:
   ```powershell
   .\docker-migrate.ps1 setup
   ```
   This will create the necessary directories and copy the environment template.

3. **Configure your environment variables**:
   - Edit the `.env` file with your actual values from your current setup
   - Make sure to include your TMDB API key, Google OAuth credentials, etc.

4. **Export your current data**:
   ```powershell
   python export_data.py
   ```
   This will create fixtures that you can import into your Docker setup.

5. **Start the Docker containers**:
   ```powershell
   .\docker-migrate.ps1 start
   ```

6. **Import your data into the Docker setup**:
   ```powershell
   .\docker-migrate.ps1 restore
   ```

7. **Test your application locally**:
   - Visit http://localhost in your browser
   - Make sure everything works as expected

8. **Once tested on Windows, migrate to Ubuntu**:
   - Copy your project files to your Ubuntu server
   - Follow the Ubuntu setup instructions in the DOCKER_MIGRATION.md file
   - Update the Nginx configuration with your server's domain or IP

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Test before migration**: You can verify everything works in Docker on Windows before moving to Ubuntu
2. **Consistent environment**: Docker ensures the same environment on both Windows and Ubuntu
3. **Easy data migration**: The export/import scripts make it easy to transfer your data
4. **Simplified deployment**: The helper scripts automate common tasks
5. **Scalability**: Docker makes it easy to scale your application in the future if needed
